### Patent Draft: Advanced Battery Management System for Electric Vehicles

#### Background Technology

The evolution of electric vehicles (EVs) has been significantly influenced by advancements in battery technology. These advancements are crucial for enhancing energy efficiency, maximizing range, and ensuring safety. A critical aspect of EV battery management involves the accurate assessment of battery health, state of charge (SOC), and state of health (SOH). Traditional battery management systems (BMS) often rely on basic algorithms that fail to capture the complex electrochemical dynamics of modern lithium-ion batteries.

Existing BMS technologies typically employ coulomb counting, voltage-based estimations, and temperature monitoring. While these methods provide a baseline understanding of battery status, they lack precision and adaptability to varying operational conditions. For instance, coulomb counting is prone to drift over time, and voltage-based methods can be inaccurate under dynamic load conditions.

#### Invention Content

Our invention presents an advanced Battery Management System (BMS) that leverages deep learning algorithms and enhanced data analytics to provide precise and adaptive battery monitoring. The system integrates multi-dimensional data inputs, including current, voltage, temperature, and historical usage patterns, to predict battery parameters with high accuracy.

**Key Innovations:**
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Utilization of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model complex battery dynamics.
- **Adaptive Learning Mechanism**: Continuous learning from real-time data to improve prediction accuracy over the battery's lifecycle.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Early detection of anomalies and degradation patterns to inform maintenance schedules.

#### Specific Implementation Methods

##### 1. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

The system acquires data from sensors embedded in the battery pack. The primary data streams include current (I), voltage (V), and temperature (T).

**Data Preprocessing Steps:**
- **Normalization**: Data is normalized to fit within a 0-1 range using the formula:
  \( x' = \frac{x - \min(x)}{\max(x) - \min(x)} \)

- **Noise Filtering**: A Kalman filter is applied to reduce measurement noise, optimizing signal clarity for further analysis.

##### 2. Model Structure

**Neural Network Architecture:**

- **Layer 1**: Convolutional Layer
  - Input: Preprocessed data matrix
  - Filters: 32
  - Activation: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
  - Output: Feature map highlighting dynamic patterns

- **Layer 2**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Layer
  - Input: Feature map from the convolutional layer
  - Units: 64
  - Output: Temporal sequences capturing time-dependent behaviors

- **Layer 3**: Fully Connected Layer
  - Input: Output from LSTM
  - Units: 128
  - Activation: Sigmoid
  - Purpose: Final prediction of SOC and SOH

**Training Loss Function:**
The model is trained using a custom loss function that balances SOC and SOH prediction accuracy:
\[ L = \alpha \cdot \text{MSE}_{\text{SOC}} + \beta \cdot \text{MSE}_{\text{SOH}} \]
where \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are weighting factors that can be adjusted based on system priorities.

##### 3. Adaptive Learning Mechanism

The system incorporates a feedback loop for adaptive learning, which recalibrates model parameters based on real-time performance metrics. The feedback loop employs reinforcement learning principles to identify optimal parameter adjustments.

##### 4. Predictive Maintenance

The predictive maintenance module analyzes data trends to identify early signs of battery degradation. The system uses anomaly detection algorithms, such as Autoencoders, to flag deviations from expected patterns.

- **Threshold Setting**: Anomaly thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on historical data and environmental conditions. The threshold \( T \) is set as:
  \[ T = \mu + k \cdot \sigma \]
  where \( \mu \) is the mean of the parameter in normal conditions, \( \sigma \) is the standard deviation, and \( k \) is a tunable sensitivity factor.

#### Benchmarking and Analysis

**Comparison with Existing Technologies:**

- **Traditional BMS**: Primarily rely on static models and fixed parameter thresholds, leading to inaccuracies under variable conditions.
- **Competitor Technologies**: Some advanced BMS systems utilize basic machine learning techniques but lack the depth of adaptive and predictive capabilities integrated into our system.

**Novelty and Advantages:**

- **Enhanced Precision**: The deep learning model significantly reduces error margins in SOC and SOH predictions.
- **Adaptability**: The system continuously learns and adapts, maintaining accuracy despite changing battery conditions.
